## Block

In Docker, a block storage driver allows you to connect to block storage devices, such as disks or iSCSI volumes, and use them as the storage back-end for your Docker containers. This allows you to have persistent storage for your containers, so that the data stored in them is not lost when the containers are stopped or removed.

## Object

On the other hand, an object storage driver allows you to connect to object storage services, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, and use them as the storage backend for your Docker containers. This allows you to store the data for your containers in a scalable, highly available, and durable manner.

## Key Differences

The key difference between the two is that block storage is typically used for storing individual files and folders, while object storage is used for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and log files. This means that block storage is better suited for applications that require fast access to a small number of files, while object storage is better suited for applications that need to store and retrieve large amounts of data.
