### Key Terms

#### Client

A machine or process that requests data or service from a server.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.

#### Server

A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.

#### Clientâ€”Server Model

The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients requesting data or service from servers and servers providing data or service to clients.

#### IP Address

An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4 addresses consist of four numbers separated by dots: `a.b.c.d` where all four numbers are between 0 and 255. Special values include:

- `127.0.0.1`: Your own local machine. Also referred to as `localhost`.
- `192.168.x.y`: Your private network. For instance, your machine and all machines on your private wifi network will usually have the `192.168` prefix.

#### Port

In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the same machine without colliding, they pick a `port` to listen on. A port is an integer between 0 and 65,535 (2^16 ports total).

Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for _system ports_ (also called _well-known_ ports) and shouldn't be used by user-level processes. Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and although you usually won't be required to have them memorized, they can sometimes come in handy. Below are some examples:

- 22: Secure Shell
- 53: DNS lookup
- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTPS

#### DNS

Short for Domain Name System, it describes the entities and protocols involved in the translation from domain names to IP Addresses. Typically, machines make a DNS query to a well known entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones) of the requested domain name in the response.
