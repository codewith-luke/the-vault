## Public Hosted Zones

A public hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain which is accessible from the public internet

- A **R53 Hosted Zone** is a DNS DB for a domain e.g lukerbab.com
- **Globally Resilient** (multiple DNS servers)
- Created with domain registration via R53 - can be created separately
- Host **DNS Records** (e.g. A, AAA, MX, NS, TXT …)
- Hosted Zones are what the DNS system references - *Authoritative* for a domain e.g. Lukerbab.com

A public hosted zone is a DNS database.

- DNS Database (zone file) hosted by R53 (Public Name Servers)
- Accessible from the public internet and VPCs
- Hosted on "*4*" R53 Name servers (*NS*), specific for the zone
- User *NS records* to point at these *NS* (connect to global DNS)
- Resource Records (*RR*) created within the Hosted Zone
- Externally registered domain can point at R53 Public Zone
