This is a bitch and took the combined effort of 6 SUPER senior dev's to get working. So save yourself some time and just install it like I say:

## First get CURL working properly

If you have curl. Just remove it. Trust me....

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo snap remove curl
sudo apt install curl
```

Now you can install NVM (follow the steps):

```

```
