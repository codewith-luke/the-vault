## Stack
-   **Stack**: An array-like data structure whose elements follow the _LIFO_ rule: Last In, First Out.
    
    A stack is often compared to a stack of books on a table: the last book that's placed on the stack of books is the first one that's taken off the stack.
    
    The following are a stack's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:
    
    -   Pushing an element onto the stack: O(1)
    -   Popping an element off the stack: O(1)
    -   Peeking at the element on the top of the stack: O(1)
    -   Searching for an element in the stack: O(n)
    
    A stack is typically implemented with a dynamic array or with a singly linked list.

## Queue

-   **Queue**: An array-like data structure whose elements follow the _FIFO_ rule: First In, First Out.
    
    A queue is often compared to a group of people standing in line to purchase items at a store: the first person to get in line is the first one to purchase items and to get out of the queue.
    
    The following are a queue's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:
    
    -   Enqueuing an element into the queue: O(1)
    -   Dequeuing an element out of the queue: O(1)
    -   Peeking at the element at the front of the queue: O(1)
    -   Searching for an element in the queue: O(n)
    
    A queue is typically implemented with a doubly linked list.
