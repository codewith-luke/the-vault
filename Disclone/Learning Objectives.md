- **Priority Queues:** Priority queues can be used to manage message timestamps in order to display the messages in chronological order. As new messages come in, they are inserted into the priority queue based on their timestamps, and the oldest messages can be retrieved and displayed first.
  
- **Trie:** A trie data structure can be utilized for implementing a feature like autocompletion or searching within the chat messages. It can efficiently store and retrieve words or phrases, enabling quick searching for specific content.
  
- **Bloom Filters:** Bloom filters can help in implementing features like message read status, where you want to quickly check if a user has seen a particular message without storing all read messages explicitly.
  
- **Compression Algorithms:** To optimize storage and transmission of media files like images or videos in the chat app, compression algorithms such as JPEG or PNG for images and H.264 or VP9 for videos can be utilized.
  
- **Encryption Algorithms:** To ensure the security and privacy of messages, end-to-end encryption using algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) can be implemented.
